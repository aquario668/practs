    <p>Chichén Itzá was a large pre-Columbian city built by the M
        aya people of the Terminal Classic period. The archeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, 
        Yucatán State, Mexico. Chichén Itzá was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic through
         the Terminal Classic and into the early portion of the Postclassic period. The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles,
          reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence
           of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mex
           ico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusio</p>
